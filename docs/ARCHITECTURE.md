# Advanced Layer Order — Architecture

*ALO* below stands for Advanced Layer Order.

One rule: **each piece does one thing, and data flows one way.**
The View shows the Model and reports what the user wants; it never acts on it.

`plugin.py` creates the pieces and wires them. It is the only module that
knows all of them.

## Responsibilities

| Piece | Does | Never |
|---|---|---|
| **Model** `model.py` | Holds the document (groups, nesting, order, expanded) and mirrors QGIS facts (layer names, effective visibility, `control_enabled`). All mutations, each followed by an event. | Import Qt or QGIS. |
| **View** `view.py`, `tree_model.py`, `tree_view.py` | Renders what it is told (`render*`). Emits one intent signal per user action, carrying all data needed (ids, target, flag). Keeps presentation state: selection, scroll. `tree_model.py` is the Qt item model presenting the rendered tree; `tree_view.py` the QTreeView. | Change what it displays because of its own input. Drops, checkbox clicks, branch arrows and the control box are reported, not applied. Read the Model. |
| **ViewController** `view_controller.py` | Turns intents into Model transactions (one undo step each) or into requests for QGIS-owned state. Turns Model events into `render*` calls. | Touch QGIS. Read state back from the View. |
| **Controller** `controller.py` | Mirrors QGIS into the Model; applies the Model's order to QGIS; persists the document; reconciles with the stock Layer Order panel. | Touch the View or the ViewController. |
| **reconcile.py** | Pure function: infer the group tree for a new flat order. | Side effects. |
| **undo.py** | `TreeStateCommand`: before/after document snapshots. | Know the View. |

## Who owns which state

| State | Owner | Written by | Undoable | Persisted in `tree_json` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Groups, nesting, order | Model | ViewController (user), Controller (reconcile, layers added/removed) | yes: ALO edits and QGIS-panel reorders (one linear history; the Controller reports `external_edit`, the ViewController records it) | yes |
| Group expanded | Model | ViewController | no | yes |
| Layer set | QGIS | Controller | no | – |
| Layer names | QGIS | Controller | no | (informative copy) |
| Layer visibility | QGIS | Controller (on request) | no | no |
| `control_enabled` | QGIS (`hasCustomLayerOrder`) | Controller (on request) | no | by QGIS |
| Selection, scroll | View | View | no | no |

Undo restores **structure only** (`Model.restore_structure`): layers QGIS
added since are kept, layers it removed are not brought back, names and
visibility keep their current values.

## Events

The Model emits `(event_type, payload)`:

* structural: `layer_added`, `layer_removed`, `group_created`,
  `group_deleted`, `item_moved` — always followed by `order_changed`;
* display: `layer_renamed`, `group_renamed`, `visibility_changed`,
  `expanded_changed`, `control_changed`;
* `model_loaded` — "resync everything". Emitted by load/replace/restore and
  at the end of a `block_notifications()` batch; the `order_changed` that
  follows it carries `{"resync": True}`.

A user action runs inside `ViewController._user_edit`: one notification
batch, so the View renders once, the Controller applies once, and one undo
step is recorded.

## Sync with QGIS

* **ALO → QGIS**: `order_changed` → `setCustomLayerOrder` (50 ms debounce).
  While writing, `_applying` is set; QGIS echoes it synchronously and the
  Controller ignores its own echoes.
* **QGIS → ALO**: layer added (placed next to its Layers-panel neighbour,
  one loop turn later because QGIS creates the tree node after
  `layersAdded`), removed, renamed, visibility, `hasCustomLayerOrder`.
* **Stock Layer Order panel display**: that panel re-reads the order only on
  `customLayerOrderChanged`, which QGIS skips for an unchanged order and
  never sends when `hasCustomLayerOrder` flips. After a control toggle (either
  checkbox) or a project load, the Controller re-sets the same order through
  an empty one so the panel shows what the map really uses.
* **Stock Layer Order panel**: a drag there changes the order twice (layer
  briefly listed twice, then removed from its old row), inside the drag's
  own event loop. The Controller handles every signal **synchronously, in
  arrival order** — never deferred, since a timer could fire between the two
  steps: a state with duplicates only records the dragged layer; the next
  clean state is reconciled with that exact hint. With the hint, only the
  dragged layer can change group (checked exhaustively in
  `test_reconcile.py`). Rules (`reconcile.py`):
  * between two members of a group → joins that group;
  * on a group's edge → stays in its original group if possible, otherwise
    becomes a sibling;
  * groups are never created or deleted.

## The tree: Qt model/view without self-editing

The tree is a `QTreeView` on `LayerOrderItemModel`, a read-only
presentation of what the ViewController rendered. Qt's editing entry
points are turned into intents and always refuse the edit:

| Qt entry point | Intent | Qt then |
|---|---|---|
| `dropMimeData(mime, row, parent)` | `drop_intent(ids, target, position)` | returns False → no row moves, source rows are not removed |
| `setData(index, CheckStateRole)` | `check_intent(id, checked)` | returns False → checkbox unchanged until rendered |
| branch arrow, double-click, ←/→ (`LayerOrderTree`) | `expand_intent(id, expanded)` | `itemsExpandable` is off → nothing expands by itself |

`render()` keeps item identity: when the set of ids is unchanged it is a
layout change with persistent indexes remapped by id, so selection,
expansion and scroll survive without being re-applied by hand.

## Drag and drop

`dropMimeData` translates Qt's `(row, parent)` into a semantic position,
anchoring on the nearest sibling that is not itself being dragged:

| position | meaning | Model operation |
|---|---|---|
| `on` a layer | new group holding target + dropped items | `create_group` + `move_items` |
| `on` a group | append to the group | `move_items(ids, group, None)` |
| `above` / `below` | sibling of the target | `move_items(ids, parent, before_id)` |
| `end` | empty area | `move_items(ids, None, None)` |

Dropping into a dragged item's own subtree is refused in
`canDropMimeData` (Qt shows the "no drop" cursor). `move_items` anchors on
a sibling id, not an index, so multi-item drops can't be thrown off by
shifting indices.

Move up / down (`Model.move_items_by_one`) is not a drop: each selected
item swaps with the nearest unselected sibling in its own parent, so
selected blocks move together and nothing ever leaves its group.

## Tests

* `make test` — PyQt6 (or `QT_API=pyqt5` for PyQt5) + pytest, no QGIS needed: Model, reconcile
  (including an exhaustive "only the dragged layer changes group"
  invariant), scenarios, and `test_dnd.py`, which drives the real View +
  ViewController + Model and asserts the View never acts on its own input.
* `make qgis-test` — `tests/qgis/check_*.py` inside real headless QGIS,
  under **every** install found (`/Applications/QGIS*.app`, MacPorts
  `/Applications/MacPorts/QGIS*.app`, or `$QGIS_APPS`): the full
  user scenario, QGIS Layer Order panel drags with the event loop running
  between its two steps, the native panel's display after toggling
  control, a reopened project staying unmodified, plugin load/unload
  + the Undo / Redo buttons, the manual-test data really showing the order on the
  map, and a headless replay of `docs/TEST_SCENARIO.md` sections 1–7
  asserting each step's ALO / Native / Map expectations.
  `check_no_leaks.py` loads/unloads the plugin and reopens the project
  repeatedly and asserts nothing is left behind (objects, widgets,
  QGIS connections, memory). Never connect a lambda or closure that
  captures `self` to a Qt signal: PyQt holds it from C++ and the object
  is never freed — connect bound methods or signals.
* `make test-data` — regenerates the manual-test project
  (`tests/data/make_test_project.py`).
* `make lint` — ruff.
* `make bench` — time and memory against the number of layers
  (`tests/perf/`); results and complexity per operation in
  [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md). `tests/test_scaling.py` guards the
  invariants the bounds rely on (the Model's id index never stale, batch
  edits equal one-by-one edits).

## Translations

No translation files are shipped. `i18n.py` lists the panel's labels as
QGIS catalog entries (context + English text, e.g.
`("QgsLayerTreeViewDefaultActions", "Move to &Top")`); `tr()` looks them
up with `QCoreApplication.translate`, so the translator QGIS installs at
startup shows them in the user's language. Labels QGIS has no entry for
stay in English. `tests/qgis/check_i18n.py` fails if a future QGIS
renames one of the borrowed entries.

## QGIS 3 and QGIS 4

One package runs on QGIS 3.40 / 3.44 (Qt 5.15, PyQt5) and QGIS 4.x (Qt 6,
PyQt6). All Qt imports go through `qgis.PyQt`; the two differences it
doesn't cover — the undo classes' module and a mouse event's position —
are in `compat.py`. The code stays Python 3.9-compatible (ruff
`target-version`), the oldest Python a 3.40 packaging may ship.

## Packaging

`make zip` builds `dist/advanced_layer_order-<VERSION>.zip` from an
explicit whitelist (the `*.py` modules, `metadata.txt`, `LICENSE`,
`icon.png`, `icons/*.svg`, `README.md`, `VERSION.md`,
`docs/DOCUMENTATION.md`) staged under the fixed folder
`advanced_layer_order` — the plugin's identity in QGIS — with plain
644/755 permissions. No dev files, hidden files or scripts, so the
plugins.qgis.org upload scan (Bandit, detect-secrets, suspicious /
executable / hidden files) has nothing to flag.
